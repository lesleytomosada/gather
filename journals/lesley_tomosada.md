Today we learned about MongoDB, and have ultimately decided to use it over PostgreSQL. When we had group time to work, we added the MongoDB database to our docker compose yaml file. We tried to hook up mongo-express and ran into some trouble. When using mongo:5, we were receiving an error about authentication, however McKenzie tried using Mongo:0.54 instead and it worked then. We were all too tired to try to look more into it but we will get to it tomorrow. MongoDB seems cool, seems simpler to use and we will have more flexibility if we want to change any fields in the future.

Today our group decided to group code our first endpoint for creating a gathering. We were all a little fuzzy on the steps but bouncing ideas off each other as well as using previous examples from class we were able to get through it and make our first post request!! This was a great AHA moment for all of us to get it working. 

We had to hard code in data since we haven't decided which database to use yet. Once we got the first endpoint done we decided to explore the Yelp API while we wait to learn about MongoDB tonight/tomorrow.

Today our group worked on:
* Finalizing our API endpoints
* Breaking down and assigning endpoints to members
* Creating issues on our gitlab issue board 

Today we were all still discussing the design together. We had our design review with James and got the ok from him as well as some additional clarification on one of the endpoints that we were having some trouble on. 

Before today I was a little fuzzy on what issues were, but creating the board and putting issues in it helped clarify that for me.
