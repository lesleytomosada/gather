Today, I worked on:
- Finishing the API Endpoints
- Assigning endpoint, tasks, and branches
- Gitlab Issues Board

The Seabeast team discussed whether an endpoint of creating a restaurant recommendation was needed. Ultimately, we agreed that the endpoint is needed in order to help with storing the selected restaurant in the database so that it can persist on the frontend of the application.

The team worked together to divide backend tasks based on endpoints and agreed that each endpoint would have its own working branch to help keep our work organized and reduce merge issues. Each member would be responsible for creating the applicable branch. We also discussed and learned to use the Gitlab issues board and created issues according to our endpoints. I learned that by adding a commit id to a comment, it can link/connect the issue with the commit. Pretty cool!
